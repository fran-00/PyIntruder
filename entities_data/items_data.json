        "ashpd": "It looks like the Zero Point Energy Field Manipulator but besides lifting things it opens portals... Of course it doesn't work, but you can effectively slam it into things.",
        "deliverance": "Allow me to deliver my bullet to your head.",
        "tesseract": "Is an Optical Character Recognition tool. That is, it will recognize and read the text embedded in images. Did you think it was a deadly weapon like in The Cube?",

        "completeness": "Every syntactically consistent, countable first-order theory has a finite or countable model. This establishes a correspondence between semantic truth and syntactic provability in first-order logic: GÃ¶del proved that first order logic is semantically complete but it is not syntactically complete, since there are sentences expressible in the language of first order logic that can be neither proved nor disproved from the axioms of logic alone.",

        "sep field": "A SEP is something we can't see, or don't see, or our brain doesn't let us see, because we think that it's Somebody Else's Problem. The brain just edits it out, it's like a blind spot.",

        "choice": "The cartesian product of non-empty sets is non-empty. Caution: may raise paradoxes.",
