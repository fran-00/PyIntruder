This establishes a correspondence between semantic truth and syntactic provability in first-order logic: GÃ¶del proved that first order logic is semantically complete but it is not syntactically complete, since there are sentences expressible in the language of first order logic that can be neither proved nor disproved from the axioms of logic alone.",
